  This is Emma's website.  Emma is a developer, writer, community organizer and a bunch of other things. I've  been working in open source for a long time and love to mentor and teach others to access the full potential of open collaboration.
  
  The intersection of technology and justice keeps me awake at night.  If you don't believe trans rights are human rights. we cannot be friends.

  Two brown schnauzers are my copilots.
